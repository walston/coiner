MacRonald's is tired of their employees giving out incorrect change.
And let's be honest, basic arithmetic is challanging, so MacRon would
like to implement a new cash-register format that displays easy exactly
*how many coins of each coin* the customer should recieve.
===
Write a function that takes in a numeric value and returns an object with the name of coins and an integer for how many coins.

```javascript
f(3.45) // => { dollars: 3, quarters: 1, dimes: 2 }
```
